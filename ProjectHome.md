Emerald is a distributed object oriented programming language where the main idea is to distribute objects.
Why not distribute objects to several phones(edge cloud?)
as Emerald is meant for mobility and distribute objects more efficiently than CORBA or even Java RMI.

In RMI, you need to setup many classes etc. to distribute objects, in Emerald you just write "move object to destination" and that is it.

I am the Teaching Assistant of for the course INF5510 Distributed Objects that is held at the University of Oslo, Department of Informatics where Emerald is what the students learn.

The page of the Emerald language, the course INF5510 and the thesis description are added as an external links.


To use Emerald on the app, press the "Launch Terminal" button which gives you a terminal (you might need to install utilities to get Emerald working), then to create an Emerald file, you need to use vi (editor) to make a file and remember that the file needs to be a .m file.


When you are finished, to compile the file type in "emc" which will go into compiler mode where you have to type in the file and then type in exit.

To compile, you type in emx filename.x and that is it!
