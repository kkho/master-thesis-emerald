\section{Syntax of Emerald}

This appendix summarizes the syntax of \emd{} discussed in this report. It
should be borne in mind that \emd{} is an active research language and is
constantly being modified.  The syntax uses EBNF (cf.~Section~\ref{lexical
considerations}), and the non-terminals have been ordered alphabetically.
