{\bf Abstract:}\\[0.15in]
The programming language Emerald was designed and developed to demonstrate
that the object-based style of programming can be incorporated both
elegantly and efficiently in a distributed programming environment.  At
the same time, Emerald is a modern programming language providing excellent
features for abstractions and polymorphism.  Primarily a language for
distributed environments, Emerald includes features for dealing with the
location of objects, and extends exception handling mechanisms to
recovering from partial failures of distributed systems.  This report
presents a concise description of the Emerald programming language.
