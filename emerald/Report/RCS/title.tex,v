{\bf Abstract:}\\[0.15in]
The programming language \emd{} was designed and developed 
to demonstrate that the
object-based style of programming can be incorporated both elegantly and
efficiently in the distributed programming environment.
At the same time, \emd{} is an '80s programming language providing excellent
features for abstraction and polymorphism. Primarily a language for distributed
environments, Emerald includes features for dealing with the location of objects,
and extends exception handling mechanisms for recovering from partial failures
of distributed systems. This report presents an overview of
Emerald and a concise description of its language constructs.
