@\section{Creating a Custom Compiler}
Two versions of the compiler are typically installed in the standard place,
which is \mytilde{}emerald/EC.  These are named execCP for the version of the
compiler that is used by default, and bestCP for an extended compiler that
has had all of the builtin types loaded and more appropriate options set.
The standard version of the compiler knows nothing about the builtin types.
The extended one is created by feeding the following input to the standard
one:

\begin{quote}
unset dogeneration\\
set exporttree\\
../Builtins/AType.m\\
../Builtins/Bitchunk.m\\
../Builtins/Boolean.m\\
../Builtins/Character.m\\
../Builtins/IVector.m\\
../Builtins/IVectorOfAny.m\\
../Builtins/Integer.m\\
../Builtins/InStream.m\\
../Builtins/Node.m\\
../Builtins/OutStream.m\\
../Builtins/Real.m\\
../Builtins/Signature.m\\
../Builtins/String.m\\
../Builtins/Time.m\\
../Builtins/Vector.m\\
../Builtins/VectorOfChar.m\\
../Builtins/CType.m\\
../Builtins/Array.m\\
set dogeneration\\
unset exporttree\\
set perfile\\
set generateconcurrent\\
checkpoint bestCP
\end{quote}

A minor variation of this procedure will cause the creation of a custom
compiler set up to compile code for your particular project.  
Add to this input lines that compile definitions that your project assumes
(in particular superclasses), loads the name table for your project, etc.

Assuming that your input script is in a file named ``input'', and the
checkpoint command provides the file name ``myCP'', the command:
\begin{quote}
  echo source input $|$ emc
\end{quote}
will cause (after a little while) the creation of a file myCP which is
probably about 2Mbytes big and contains your custom compiler.  You run it by
typing:
\begin{quote}
  emx myCP
\end{quote}

You can optimize this process by starting with bestCP and using a script
like:

\begin{quote}
load whatever\\
unset dogeneration\\
set exporttree\\
unset doselfs\\
baseclassfile.m\\
set dogeneration\\
unset exporttree\\
checkpoint myCP
\end{quote}
