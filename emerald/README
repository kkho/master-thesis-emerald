This is the Emerald Distributed Programming Language

This package is a redistribution of the original package under the GPL.
The original package is at the moment available at 
http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~norm/emerald.html (might change in the future).

We have redistributed the package so as to make it available to the public, 
as well as to make it available on modern architectures. In particular the
original package had a dependency on the 'csh' shell which we have tried 
to eliminate so that it now uses the more widely available 'sh'.

Quick installation instructions
===============================

  1. unpack the package to the location where you want to install emerald 
  (eg. /opt - The package is then unpacked in the directory 
  emerald-PACKAGEVERSION under /opt)

  2. Set EMERALDROOT in your environment to point to this directory (eg.
  export EMERALDROOT=/opt/emerald )

  3. set EMERALDARCH to your architecture type (probably 'i686mt', look in bin for other possibilities. normally the output of 'arch' will suffice)

  3. run ./configure. 
  Add --prefix=install_location if you want the emerald binaries to be
  installed somewhere else than /usr/local

  4. run make

  5. run make install (you might need to be root)

Otherwise read INSTALL for generic installation instructions

In 'Doc' are the installation instructions and other documents of the original
